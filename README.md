# Double-pendulum-python
Double pendulum is a classical mechanical system consisting of two 
interconnected pendulums, and its motion is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
I have written a Python code that traces the path of a double pendulum. 
This Python program simulates the motion of a double pendulum using numerical integration and the Runge-Kutta method. The user can change
the length, mass, time period, initial angular velocities, initial angles and lengths of string to see the desired effects.
A Great way to understand chaotic , stable and elliptical behavior by actually observing the plot.
